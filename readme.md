# DotLiquid for pretzel

## Purpose

This repo for [pretzel](https://github.com/AmmRage/pretzel) only. Might not compatible with other scenes.

## Motivation

The maintainer of orig repo seems not willing to accept pr for some specified scenario. I also don't think it's a good idea to binding the lib to something.
